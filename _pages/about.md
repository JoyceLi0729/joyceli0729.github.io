I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am part of the Data Analysis, Learning, and Inference (DALI) Group advised by Professor [Arindam Bernajee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/). I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics and Probability from Peking University. My research explores various topics in machine learning, including deep learning theory, federated learning, differential privacy analysis, and fairness processing and transformation.
